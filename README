# CityLocalTime
CityLocalTime is a application where users can retrieve the local time, date of multiple given cities and displays them to the user. The application piggybacks off of a web application in order to find the qualified location of the user input as well the timezone id of the provided city. The timezone id is then used in conjuunction with Joda-Time in order to get the local time of the city. Going through the web application also provides the functionality of predicting what city an user would like the time of without having to be specific (I.E. Miami instead of Miami, Florida) as well as minimal spell check (I.E. Los Angelos->Los Angeles).

# properties.txt
This file will change what the application displays and how it displays information to the user. Properties are activated by setting the text after each property to TRUE/true no spaces.
	Table Formats: Determines what and how information will be displayed once all times are retrieved
		pretty: 				Pad columns so that table is aligned
		sort: 					Sort the inputted cities so that they are alphebetically displayed 
		location: 			Display name of the city as well as state/province/country it belongs to
		timezone: 			Display the timezone id of the city
		date: 					Displays the current local date of the city
		time: 					Displays the current local time of the city
	Location Formats: Determines what is displayed if the location of the city is displayed
		city: 					Display the city name
		province: 			Display the state/province of the city (some cities may be affiliated with only a country)
		country: 				Display the country of the city
	Time Formats: Determines what and how the local time of the city is displayed if displayed
		24hour:					Changes the time displayed to a 24 hour format
		seconds:				Displays the seconds in the time
	Date Formats: Determines how local dates of a city are displayed if displayed
		weekday:				Display the current day of the week of the city
		full_weekday:		Determines how the weekday is displayed (Tuesday/Tues)
		full_month:			Determines how the month is displayed (September/Sept)

# input.txt
Used in conjuntion with "make test" which will redirect input.txt input the standard input stream. This file is used to automatically retrieve the times of cities within that are separated by "|". Currently there is a bug which causes a NoSuchElementException to be thrown, this is likely because of how scanner is used, currently have not found a solution

# MAKEFILE
Compile: make
Run: make run
Run Tests: make test

Future Updates:
Add ability to format the city being displayed (Currently only displays full location)
Clean up code (especially main())
Add comments to code
Make pretty print look like a table
Move JAR files to their own folder and figure out how to compile with that class path
Add option to update times of currently looked up cities or keep them always updates
Possibly export city to timezone id mapping to not depend on web service (cause loss in city prediction)

Bugs:
NoSuchElementException thrown when redirecting a test file into input (Likely caused by second scan)
